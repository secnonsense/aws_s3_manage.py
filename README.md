# aws_s3_manage.py
Gemini generated script using tkinter gui for quickly creating users, profiles, s3 prefixes and bucket policy. Requires boto3, python3.6 or greater and aws keys stored in ~/.aws/credentials (or homedirectory\.aws\credentials on Windows). The premise is to quickly generate an IAM user, generate aws keys, store them locally in the .aws credentials file, create a new prefix in a specified s3 bucket and apply s3 bucket policy so that IAM user has access to only that "folder" in that s3 bucket.  Script also has buttons to remove the user, profile and bucket policy as well as the s3 prefix (folder). Recommended to use with a new s3 bucket without existing bucket policy.  Otherwise use with caution.
